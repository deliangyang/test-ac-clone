# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch

  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
